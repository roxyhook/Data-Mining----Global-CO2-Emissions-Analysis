The aim of this project is to explore the relationship between COâ‚‚ emissions and various socio-economic factors across countries. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study investigates patterns, correlations, and disparities to better understand how population, development indicators, and environmental or economic policies influence emissions. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can inform climate change mitigation strategies, sustainable development policies, and global cooperation efforts.
